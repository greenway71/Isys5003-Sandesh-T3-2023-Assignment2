This is the prototype  version of the game called "Space Battle". The greyboxing prototype is used in order to design the game layout and test the durability in short amount of time.This process really saved my time to design it and test how the game would look and feel like. 

The game comprise of two scene at the moment since it is in its inital phase of development. The two menu are Main Menu and Spaceship menu. The Main Menu contains background image of desserted mars planet to give the feel of space. There are three button, (START,SETTINGS,QUIT). START button help to navigate to spaceship menu and QUIT button is used to quit the game; Users need to load the game again in their browser to interact with the Main Menu. The Spaceship menu consists of navigation button for movement of the Spaceship in different direction.It consists of (UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT) button. Also, there are other function such as (GROW,SHRINK,ROTATE,RESET) button. 

Feel free to play the game and drop your valuable feedback in the comment section. I would take your valuable feedback for making further improvement in the game.
